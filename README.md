## Alpha Sprint Comments

- There was a bit of confusion with the `.env` files. Lwazi copied the `.env` file the professor sent into the modules, but the instructions were unclear about where it should go.
- Setting up GitHub Pages presented some challenges since only the repository owner could publish it. We wanted to delegate the task instead of having the owner do it, so we ended up having Thomas get it live.
